# Reference Genome {#refgenome}

* Navigate to ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/ and identify the latest release of the Ensembl reference genomes. As of writing this guide, the latest is `release-95`.
* For a given release, you will want to identify `cdna` and `gtf` files for your species. For example, when working with human data, the files are

ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/fasta/homo_sapiens/cdna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz and
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.95.gtf.gz

* Ensure that you are in the `reference/` subfolder of your project.
* Download the reference files using the `wget` command:

```
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/fasta/homo_sapiens/cdna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.95.gtf.gz
```

* If you are interested in also looking at the non-coding regions, you will want to download the matching `ncrna` file. Following the `release-95` example above, the download command will be

```
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/fasta/homo_sapiens/ncrna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.ncrna.fa.gz
```

* After downloading both `cdna` and `ncrna`, merge the two together into a single file:

```
cat Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.ncrna.fa.gz > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.95.fa.gz
```

## Digital Gene Expression

No additional steps required.

## Deep RNAseq {#spike-in}

When working with deep RNAseq data, you will also need to account for the [ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4456739) that is often used for quality control.

* Determine the version of the spike in used in your experiment.
* Identify the FASTA file that catalogues spike-in sequences from the [vendor's page](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4456739). This can usually be found under the manuals tab. As of writing this, ERCC92 is the latest version with the FASTA available at https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip
* Download the spike-in file to your `reference/` subdirectory:
```
wget https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip
```
* Unzip the downloaded file to retrieve the FASTA sequences: `unzip ERCC92.zip`
